<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and decrease risk from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a way that reduces general financial, health, and ecological risks.</p>
<p>Current studies document the requirement for continued decreases in hazardous pesticide use and practices. Although the fundamental elements of IPM are constantly the very same, the specific components of an IPM program differ from one environment or circumstance to another. Application of predatory mites versus thrips in potted plants is more efficient when done before spacing the plants.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest issues, classical biological control method is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>To design and implement best practices of pest management in organic farming, it is also needed to have accurate understanding of crop and pest biology, ecology, phenology and of pest-crop interactions, while following strictly controlled rules of organic farming. There are many do-it-yourself ways and treatments and finest practices that anybody can follow to remove pests from his area.</p>
