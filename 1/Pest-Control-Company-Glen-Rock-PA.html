<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem approach to crop production and security that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and decrease the use of pesticides. Considerable decreases in the volumes and toxicity of pesticides applied can be accomplished when an IPM program has actually been carried out appropriately.
