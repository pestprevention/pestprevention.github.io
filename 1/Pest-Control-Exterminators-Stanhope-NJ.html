<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest effective dosage when other methods of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of strategies such as biological control, environment adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>If pesticides are necessary, they are selected and used in a way that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Nearly every kind of pest positions a danger to the residential or commercial properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
