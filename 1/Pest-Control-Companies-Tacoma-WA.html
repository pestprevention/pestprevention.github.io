Under EPM, chemicals must be used only as a last hope, after mechanical, cultural, and biological techniques have been attempted and shown inefficient. Different pest control chemicals are hazardous and might be harmful, if not used properly.</p>
<p>They are selected and used in a way that prevents disrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are necessary. Practically every type of pest poses a hazard to the homes they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used just after routine monitoring indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the cost of the control steps.</p>
