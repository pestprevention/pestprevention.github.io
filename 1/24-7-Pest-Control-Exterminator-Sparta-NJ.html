<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a efficient and environmentally delicate  technique to pest control. These might or might not include materials listed on the Organic Materials Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides utilized in organic farming and organic gardening are generally more secure than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than artificial pesticides and can cause harm.</p>
<p>Current studies document the requirement for ongoing reductions in dangerous pesticide use and practices. Although the fundamental parts of IPM are constantly the very same, the specific elements of an IPM program vary from one environment or circumstance to another.

To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically used where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and planned management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low environmental effect. Professional exterminators use different kinds of baits and pesticides to kill and remove pests.
