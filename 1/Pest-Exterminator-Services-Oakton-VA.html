<h3>Outdoor Pest Control Oakton VA 22124</h3>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove since growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan. If your center currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to approach least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dose when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest problems, classical biological control technique is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
