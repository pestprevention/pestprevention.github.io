<p>In reference to the concept of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
