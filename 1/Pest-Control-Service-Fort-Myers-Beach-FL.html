<p>The determination of the appropriate reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect types or life phases.</p>
<p>Many more recent pesticides are stemmed from plants or naturally taking place substances (e.g.-- pyrethrum, pest and nicotine juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active component might be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. If we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), most researchers agree that this will be possible only.</p>
