<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a efficient and ecologically sensitive  approach to pest control. These might or might not consist of products listed on the Organic Products Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides utilized in organic farming and organic gardening are usually more secure than artificial pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than artificial pesticides and can trigger damage.</p>
<p>When pest problems are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>

<p>Their professional exterminators are readily available for 24 hr of emergency services for their important clients. Nevertheless, the high potential for reproduction of insect pests remains, and a population surge of numerous types can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever appropriate environmental conditions take place or control slackens. Under this scheme, bug control was "supervised" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from routine monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest effective dosage when other methods of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, environment control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest issues, classical biological control technique is normally used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>To create and carry out best practices of pest management in organic farming, it is also necessary to have accurate understanding of crop and pest biology, ecology, phenology and of pest-crop interactions, while following strictly managed rules of natural farming. There are many do-it-yourself methods and treatments and best practices that anyone can follow to eliminate pests from his area.</p>
