<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house unappealing to them. But home pests can also be a risk to your family.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is triggered hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy community likely will have a great deal of big, costly homes, so pest control expenses might be greater there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those homes.</p>

Examples include cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting sites, trap crops, and adjusting the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
