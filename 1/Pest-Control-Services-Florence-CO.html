Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and lower the damage they inflict.</p>
<p>The approach to be selected for IPM depends on many aspects, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests cause significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If fundamental home hygiene is ignored, the effects of other types of pest control will be exceptionally temporary as the pests will soon be back, and in higher numbers.</p>
