<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods as well as its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds.

<p>Biological control approaches can also be viewed as natural solutions as they do not depend on using pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is required due to the fact that insects and rodents carry diseases, infest your cooking areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your pets. Use sign plants to identify the efficacy of pest management methods and to keep an eye on susceptible crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic spot infection (INSV) and tomato spotted wilt infection (TSWV).</p>
