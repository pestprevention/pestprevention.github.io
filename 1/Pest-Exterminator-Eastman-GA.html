Our teams of professional Pest Control Technicians embrace the IPM technique to pest control and are able to supply service to satisfy the pest management requirements of any business or residential consumer.</p>
<p>The determination of the correct cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life phases.</p>

IPM is more than likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in truth requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or packaging, and the facility itself will bring in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
