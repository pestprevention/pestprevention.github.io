The EPA regulates this type of general-use pesticide within the United States permitting it to just be sold and set up by licensed pest management specialists as part of an integrated pest management program.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family bug pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about decreasing pesticide use.
