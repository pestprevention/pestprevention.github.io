<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound techniques along with its array of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

Home pests can include insects such as flies, cockroaches and mosquitoes, or rodents like mice or rats. I have attempted numerous pest control vendors including well recognized national level brands in the business, but have never come across anyone who reveals this degree of professional insight and method.</p>
