<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a environmentally benign and cost-effective  pest control strategy preferably suited for both little and big farmers around the globe. When termites have entered a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making process in which observations (from examination and tracking) are utilized to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, insecticides that are more selective since they are most reliable versus insects with particular feeding routines, at specific life stages, or within particular taxonomic groups, are described as "biorational" pesticides. Founded in 1967, it is the leading association of the expert pest management markets, with over 350 members throughout the nation.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses a number of the very same ideas as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
