<p>Before signing an agreement for pest control, you ought to be clear about the cost being paid, the services being covered and the existence of cancellation charges, Anti-Pesto says. You can utilize traps to capture particular pests, and barriers to secure plants from insect attack or illness infection. Along the continuum, additional non-chemical strategies such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop ranges, mating disturbance, sterilized bug release, etc., might be incorporated into the system.</p>
