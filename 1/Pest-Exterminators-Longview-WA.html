<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about lowering pesticide use.

<p>Efficient, less risky pest controls are chosen initially, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is typically one of the most important actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ).
