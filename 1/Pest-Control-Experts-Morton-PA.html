<p>Correctly identify pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of different control alternatives, pest biology and damage capacity, and viability of readily available resources makes it possible for the grower to make a decision appropriate for their situation. Greenhouses supply an ideal environment (e.g., temperature level and light) for various biological control agents or natural opponents consisting of parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>Natural opponents can be effective, and pesticides (chemical substances for controlling pests) are only used when alternative choices do not produce the necessary result. Expert pest control exterminators must constantly survey and check prior to acting. The chemical pest control and the herbal pest control approaches are the 2 primary different types of pest control methods that are in need.</p>
<p>This details, in combination with readily available pest control methods, is used to manage pest damage by the most cost-effective means, and with the least possible threat to people, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are always the last resort in an IPM program. This is talked about in Chapter 16.
