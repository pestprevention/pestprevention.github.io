<p>Tighter guidelines for food safety, occupational health and wellness, and the environment suggest in-house pest control isn't a choice for numerous food companies nowadays. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production obstacles where the most typical problems are pests, which include illness, insects, and weeds. Similarly, pest and crop management disciplines need to collaborate to develop control recommendations that show these interactions.</p>

To minimize potential harm to helpful insects, restrict your spraying to little locations where you can see pests prowling, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
