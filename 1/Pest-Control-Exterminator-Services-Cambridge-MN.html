<p>As discussed previously, understanding about the environmental correlations between insects and their environment is important to effective pest management. Recently, the European Union has embraced IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business should understand it has an equivalent function to play in pest control" with the pest management professional, states Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house uninviting to them. However family pests can also be a threat to your household. When searching for a location to infest, pests choose to hide in a place that supplies food and a safe breeding place. Biological control is much easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies many of the exact same principles as IPM however limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
