This mix of IGRs can be reliable in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause severe damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators carry out more complex jobs, have the ability to utilize a wider series of pesticides, and may specialize in a specific area of pest control.</p>
