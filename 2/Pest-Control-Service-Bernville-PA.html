Crop rotation: Monocultures provide possible cotton pests with plentiful food sources, triggering their populations to increase rapidly.</p>
<p>Because of their potential damage to pest control employees, customers, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are heavily regulated by Federal law. Fungus: Beauveria bassiana is utilized for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions in between crop and pest (as well as the environment) are very important.
