<p>Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after routine tracking shows that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to traditional artificial pesticides-- in a practical, long-lasting strategy. Biopesticides are typically suitable with natural opponents, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p>The success of control strategies should be determined utilizing indications based upon tracking of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and impact on the environment. These consist of the resurgence of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
<p>Recognition of the pest, comprehending its biology and seasonal population trends, destructive life stages and their habitats, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life stage for several control options, host choice and alternate hosts, predictability of pest event based upon the environment, cropping trends, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the related information is important for identifying an efficient control method.</p>
