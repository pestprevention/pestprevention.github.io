<p>The 4 major issues come across with conventional pesticides are harmful residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest resurgence (Lewis, 1997 ). Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are synthetic and encouraged pesticides should just be used as a last hope or only used as needed and frequently only at specific times in a pests life process.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques in addition to its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
