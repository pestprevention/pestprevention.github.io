<h3>Termite Control Options Boerne TX 78006</h3>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into account a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
