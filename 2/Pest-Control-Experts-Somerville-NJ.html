Socio-psychological aspects including ethical and rational factors to consider were discovered to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
