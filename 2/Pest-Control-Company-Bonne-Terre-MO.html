SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger major damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens.

<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies a number of the exact same concepts as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
