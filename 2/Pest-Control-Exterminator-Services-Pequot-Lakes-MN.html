<p>Pesticides are chosen and used in a way that lessens their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the ingredients or product packaging, and the facility itself will bring in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>Biological control methods can likewise be seen as natural options as they do not rely on using pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is necessary due to the fact that rodents and insects bring illness, infest your kitchens and bed rooms, and bite you or your pets. Use indicator plants to figure out the effectiveness of pest management methods and to keep an eye on susceptible crops for the viruses (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) and tomato identified wilt virus (TSWV).</p>

Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring showed that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.</p>
