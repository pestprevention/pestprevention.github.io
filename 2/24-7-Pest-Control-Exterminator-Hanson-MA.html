<p>Advanced integrated pest management utilizes ingenious options. We provide Integrated Pest Management service for virtually every kind of pest in every type of building or industry. Prevention of key pest problems might be more easily achieved if the grower and scout take the time to determine, analyze and remedy issues before crops are presented.</p>
<p>The decision of the proper cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect types or life stages.</p>
<p>The many varying hazards from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these nations, regular use of pesticides is restricted to high worth (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
<p>Other consistent and emerging pest problems include vectored human and animal illness such as West Nile virus, Eastern horse encephalitis and Lyme disease; plant pests and illness such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 harmful aquatic, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and elsewhere, and demand reliable pest management steps.</p>
