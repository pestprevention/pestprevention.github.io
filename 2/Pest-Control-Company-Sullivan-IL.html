<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off since growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement.

<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Instruction on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are needed to think about the principles of IPM prior to using chemicals. Biological pest control is a technique of managing pests such as insects and mites by utilizing other organisms 8 It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but generally likewise involves an active human management role.</p>
<p>You just need to invest an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by global concerns: the vicious circle that develops from using big quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most crucial part of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will practically have run out.</p>
