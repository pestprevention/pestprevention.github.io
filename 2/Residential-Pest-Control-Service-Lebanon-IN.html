When termites have actually gone into a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.

<p>In recommendation to the idea of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later widened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

<p>Also, think about how the variety of plants to be grown in the very same location may influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control relates to non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the location tidy and totally free of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the area between the bottom of the flooring and a door.</p>
