The advantage of the fogging pest control method is that it's thought about to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned up. Cultural practices - count on a method to make the crop or environment undesirable to pests by interfering with their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or place by both immatures and adults.</p>
