Specific biostimulants based upon minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stress factors, however are applied as changes without any claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new items or innovations can fall under several abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
