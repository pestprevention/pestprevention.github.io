For that reason, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although useful in reducing ecological contamination and safety problems, still does not genuinely resolve the environmentally based weak point of the standard pest control approach.</p>

Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry contaminants in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
