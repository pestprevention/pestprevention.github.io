<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are committed to offering the very best possible service to secure versus undesirable pests. The following example explains the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants. Focusing primarily on long-lasting pest avoidance, a successful IPM program makes use of a mix of control methods consisting of biological control, habitat manipulation, modifications to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>The decision of the right reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.

You can utilize traps to catch certain pests, and barriers to safeguard plants from insect attack or disease infection. Along the continuum, additional non-chemical strategies such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop ranges, mating interruption, sterile insect release, etc., might be integrated into the system.</p>
