<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community technique to crop production and defense that integrates different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and lessen the use of pesticides. By finishing and making use of an IPM strategy, members might have the ability to save money on pest control methods which were previously utilized and can possibly reduce future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Because they are usually more reliable and can normally be used to control a number of pests, the bulk of insecticides fall into the chemical classification.
