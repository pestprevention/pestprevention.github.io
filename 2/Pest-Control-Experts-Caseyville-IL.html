<h3>An Earth Friendly Approach to Pest Control Caseyville IL</h3>
<p>Although several sources define IPM in different ways, previous designs mostly focused on the ecological, and to some level on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) recognized a lack of a holistic IPM technique that uses both standard and modern tools.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are used just when required and in mix with other methods for more efficient, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, because they are compatible with other pest management tactics, especially biological control.
