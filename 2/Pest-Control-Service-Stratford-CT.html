<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and basic pest control, consisting of structural pest management, grass pest management and decorative pest management.

IPM is more than likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in fact requirement based use of chemicals.
