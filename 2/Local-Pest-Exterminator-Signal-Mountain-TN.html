<p>The behavior of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disruption methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound methods along with its array of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds.
