The following example explains the 6 elements of an Integrated Pest Management program used to handle carpenter ants. Focusing generally on long-term pest prevention, a successful IPM program utilizes a mix of control methods including biological control, habitat control, changes to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
