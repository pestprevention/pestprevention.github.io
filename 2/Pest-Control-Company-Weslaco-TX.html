<p>Below ground termites are the most destructive termites in the United States. Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without triggering economic damage. Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides instead of normal baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property also have proven to significantly decrease the total volumes of pesticides applied.
