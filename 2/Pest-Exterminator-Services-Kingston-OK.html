For that reason, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although practical in minimizing environmental contamination and safety problems, still does not really attend to the environmentally based weak point of the conventional pest control method.</p>

Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
