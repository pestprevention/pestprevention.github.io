<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is typically used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Releases of natural opponents might be needed throughout the growing season in order to sustain arthropod pests at low populations. Reducing using pesticides is also essential as an increasing variety of pests are establishing resistance to chemical pest control. Non target species like natural opponents of bug get impacted.
