D's has actually been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming resulting from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the idea of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
