<p>WebMD veterinary professionals response frequently asked questions about fleas and ticks on your dog. Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement.
