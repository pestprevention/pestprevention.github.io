You can utilize traps to capture particular pests, and barriers to secure plants from insect attack or illness infection. Along the continuum, additional non-chemical techniques such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop varieties, mating disruption, sterilized insect release, etc., may be integrated into the system.</p>
<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, reliable against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable against red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixtures, mixes of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
