Versatility and Time- The process of pest control takes some time and efforts. Pests are undesirable plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is generally used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Releases of natural opponents may be required throughout the growing season in order to sustain arthropod pests at low populations. Lowering using pesticides is also important as an increasing number of pests are developing resistance to chemical pest control. Non target types like natural enemies of pest get affected. June 6, 2020 is World Pest Day, an annual observance to raise awareness about the essential function that pest control professionals play in securing health, food, property and the environment from pest risks all over the world.</p>
