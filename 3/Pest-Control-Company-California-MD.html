<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) protects environment through removal of unneeded pesticide applications. These professionals understand the impact of pesticides and ensure they use the proper ones (in the correct amount) and apply it in such a way that you and your family are exposed to little or no risk after the application. Considering that 2003, most of new pesticide registrations have satisfied requirements set by EPA for minimized threat" consisting of lower hazards to human health and non-target organisms, and lower potential for contamination of groundwater, surface water, and other ecological resources.</p>
<p>There are many farming practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all tactics. This chapter discusses different methods to preserve pest insects at bearable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and animals far from areas where pesticides have actually been used.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a process that is utilized to control pest populations while reducing the impacts on people and the surrounding environment. Though there is a controversy of utilizing chemicals due to environmental pollution it is a fact that this is the only approach which is widely accepted and provided efficient control of pest.</p>
<p>This technique of pest control has fallen out of favour in recent years since fire eliminates helpful insects together with the pests and can have a negative impact on the soil. To minimize possible harm to useful insects, limit your spraying to little locations where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
