<p>Bayer is committed to helping foster much healthier environments where individuals live, work and play.

<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are immense directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are four significant components in the brand-new IPM design that attend to different pest management alternatives, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to resolve the pest issue, planning and company of information to take proper management actions, and preserving great communication to disseminate and obtain knowledge about pests and their management.</p>
