<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in an organic system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can just do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators need to take an active role in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
