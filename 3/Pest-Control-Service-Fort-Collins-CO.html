<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>This technique of pest control has fallen out of favour in current years because fire kills helpful insects in addition to the pests and can have an unfavorable impact on the soil. To lessen prospective damage to helpful insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests hiding, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
