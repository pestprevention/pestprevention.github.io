<p>Termites are nasty customers. For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management methods, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of routine examinations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though disputed by some as a valid measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the climax of pest control.</p>
<p>Pesticide threats include intense, immediate toxicity to human beings and other non-target organisms; long-lasting or persistent toxicity such as cancer; and environmental contamination of the air, or ground and surface area water.

<p>Crop varieties can vary significantly in their susceptibility to pests and diseases.
