<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like spiders, roaches, or ants, we will identify the source of the problem. The goal is to provide a total understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the principles for implementation in all crops. When a crop is under tension it can be less capable of dealing with the tension caused by insects that extract plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this tension may a little reduce the financial threshold.</p>
