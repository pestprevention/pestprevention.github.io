To resolve invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is generally used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

<p>That's why we'll treat your pest problem with the most effective treatments offered. Lots of natural enemies of pests are killed by pesticides, freeing pests from these natural controls. We educate our clients on pests, pest habitat and steps for handling pests safely and successfully.

<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. However household pests can also be a danger to your family. When looking for a place to infest, pests choose to hide in a location that provides food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to carry out in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>Other consistent and emerging pest problems consist of vectored animal and human diseases such as West Nile infection, Eastern horse sleeping sickness and Lyme illness; plant pests and illness such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 poisonous marine, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and elsewhere, and demand efficient pest management steps.</p>
