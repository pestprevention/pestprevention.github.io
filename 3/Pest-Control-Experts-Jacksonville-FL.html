<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove since growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>To ensure least impact of our pest treatments on environments, we utilize items that trigger least impact on the environment.
