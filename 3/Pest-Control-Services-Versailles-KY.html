However, the high capacity for recreation of insect pests remains, and a population explosion of lots of species can be expected from a low-density level whenever suitable environmental conditions happen or control slackens.

<p>The term "integrated" was therefore synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used just after routine monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the cost of the control steps.</p>
