<p>Socio-psychological factors including ethical and rational factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM execution in developed nations.</p>
<p>Natural opponents can be reliable, and pesticides (chemical substances for controlling pests) are only utilized when alternative options do not produce the necessary result. Expert pest control exterminators must always survey and inspect before acting. The chemical pest control and the herbal pest control approaches are the 2 primary different kinds of pest control methods that are in need.</p>
