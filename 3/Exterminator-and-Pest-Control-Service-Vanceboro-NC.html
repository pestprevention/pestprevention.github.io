<p>Biological control techniques can also be seen as natural services as they do not count on making use of pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is essential since insects and rodents carry illness, infest your kitchens and bed rooms, and bite you or your animals. Use indicator plants to figure out the effectiveness of pest management tactics and to keep an eye on vulnerable crops for the viruses (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic spot infection (INSV) and tomato found wilt infection (TSWV).</p>
