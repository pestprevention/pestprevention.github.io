<h3>Pest Control Rodents Maryville Illinois</h2>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is usually used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
