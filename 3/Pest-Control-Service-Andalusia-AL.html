<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in such a way that lessens their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based use of chemicals.

Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making process for handling pests in an effective, cost-effective and environmentally sound way.
