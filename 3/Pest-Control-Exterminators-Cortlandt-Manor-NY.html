<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Instruction on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are needed to consider the concepts of IPM before the use of chemicals.

<p>If pesticides are essential, they are picked and used in a manner that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest presents a threat to the properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
