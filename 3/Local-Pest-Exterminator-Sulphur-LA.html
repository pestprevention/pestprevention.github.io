However, the high potential for recreation of insect pests remains, and a population explosion of lots of types can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever appropriate environmental conditions occur or control slackens. Under this plan, insect control was "monitored" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods along with its array of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>We're applying our proficiency to develop more sustainable and effective pest control techniques.
