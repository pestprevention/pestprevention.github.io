IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all strategies. This chapter goes over various methods to maintain pest insects at tolerable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep family pets and children far from areas where pesticides have actually been applied.</p>
