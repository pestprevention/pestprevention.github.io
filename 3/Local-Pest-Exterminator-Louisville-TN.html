Don't base pest management programs on total removal of a pest. Pests assault plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae damage leaves and berries originating from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>We look at the big image and focus on long term avoidance of pests by carrying out pre-treatment inspections, determining conditions favorable to pests, de-webbing, placement of keeping track of gadgets, sanitation suggestions, prevention & exclusion, and applying pesticides in a safe and strategic  way are all examples of how Mills PM executes the practices of IPM.</p>
