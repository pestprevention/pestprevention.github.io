A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of qualified IPM specialists and extension educators was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest perseverance include intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
