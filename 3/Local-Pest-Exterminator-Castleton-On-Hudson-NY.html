<p>Socio-psychological aspects including ethical and reasonable considerations were found to the chauffeurs in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of qualified IPM professionals and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM execution in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>As gone over formerly, knowledge about the ecological correlations between insects and their environment is vital to effective pest management. Recently, the European Union has embraced IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business need to realize it has an equal function to play in pest control" with the pest management expert, says Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Throughout the argument on alternative methods for managing pests, different concepts have actually been expressed and brand-new approaches have emerged. What is thought about a great IPM program today may be considered a chemical intensive program in a couple of years. Use appropriate crop rotation practices and target pests with multiple modes of action to make it harder for pests to adapt.</p>
