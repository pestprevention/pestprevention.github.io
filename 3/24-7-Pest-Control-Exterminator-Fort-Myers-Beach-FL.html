Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a environmentally sensitive and efficient method to pest management that depends on a combination of common-sense practices. IPM is a technique to make sure financial viability at both customer and producer level (seller is always anticipated to make a profit), ecological security through a balanced usage of all readily available pest control options, and social reputation considering that IPM-based food is inexpensive and safe.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, location within the greenhouse, and the number of plants inspected. It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides may be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these thresholds change for modifications in market prices, stage of crop growth, cost of pesticides, etc., however in truth most are based upon fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
