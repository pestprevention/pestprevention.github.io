<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about reducing pesticide use.

<p>A strategy that includes using pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through standard breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that lower the plant's attractiveness or suitability for the pest to feed, establish, or reproduce successfully.</p>
